### Hi there 👋

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.

I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
**When I'm not in front of a computer screen doing research or trading**, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

#### Goals in 2021
- 🚀 Learn how to drive, and go on a road trip to the east coast of Taiwan
- ⚡️ Lose 6kgs in weights and back to the gym
- 🤫 Others
