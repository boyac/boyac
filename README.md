I embarked on an exciting path of quantitative analysis, which led me to venture into the field of investment research. Starting with equities, my journey gradually expanded to encompass bonds, alternative investments, and risk management. Growing up, I had the opportunity to observe a family memberâ€™s futures-oriented investment small business, and it instilled in me a healthy skepticism towards overly idealized success stories. I realized that investment failures can have significant and long-lasting consequences on individualsâ€™ lives. This realization emphasized the importance of thoroughly understanding the unique characteristics and potential risks associated with any investment tool before incorporating it into oneâ€™s strategy.
