### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm formerly an analyst at CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB and a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, 
Taiwan's largest asset management company and a tier-one financial institution. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
I love exploring oppertunities and vehicles in the capital market to maximize profits.
**When I'm not in front of a computer screen doing research or trading**, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
I'm also a CPA candidate for New York State in 2021/2022, which is also one item I'd like to cross off my bucket list before I hit 35.
