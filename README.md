Not having a traditional CS degree has actually opened up more possibilities for me. My journey began with a humble 286 model in second grade, sparking my early interest in quantitative analysis. This passion guided me into investment research, where I've delved into equities, bonds, alternative investments, and risk management. Despite not following a conventional educational path, my self-taught coding skills have garnered attention from fintech and medical professionals abroad. This unconventional background has empowered me to tackle challenges with a fresh perspective and swiftly adapt to emerging technologies, creating avenues for exciting collaborations and opportunities."
