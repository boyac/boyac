### Hi there 👋

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
**When I'm not in front of a computer screen doing research or trading**, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
