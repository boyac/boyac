### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
When I'm not in research or trading, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
Last year, I joined Cathay SITE's of its new department. 
With 2 people we were able to bring over $155M in AUM to the Company and carring a heavy load for product design and actively manage a fund for the government.
I'm currently under pay 200% due to the Company structural issue than people I'm working with. 
I was asked my gender, marital status while interviewing. However, those are the things I couldn't and won't be able to change.
And I don't want to be under pay 200% in the coming year in 2021. Thus, I'm open to good oppertunies and relocation!
I'm very confident I can generate more profits to your Company than you paid me.
