### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, formerly an analyst at CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB and a multi-asset Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, and a tier-one financial institution. 
I started this GitHub in 2014 based on my interest and not associated with any of my employers. And I have 7 years of related working experience in the international financial market for investment and research, including 3 years working overseas. I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy (GraSPP) with a quantitative-focused program in applied economics.
I love exploring opportunities and different vehicles, e.g. mutual funds, equity, fixed income, index, alternative products in the capital market to maximize profits. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
