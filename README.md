Not having a traditional CS degree has actually opened up more possibilities for me. My journey began with a humble 286 model in second grade, sparking my early interest in quantitative analysis. This passion guided me into investment research, where I've explored equities, bonds, alternative investments, and risk management. Despite not following a conventional educational path, my self-taught coding skills have garnered attention from fintech and medical professionals abroad. This unconventional background has empowered me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective and adapt quickly to emerging technologies, creating opportunities for exciting collaborations and growth. As I continue exploring the vast world of opportunities in this field and keeping a vigilant eye on emerging market trends, I am driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully, develop my skills, and pursue personal fulfillment.
