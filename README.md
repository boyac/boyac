### Hi there 👋

I'm **Boya Chiou**, formerly an analyst at Crédit Agricole CIB and a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, and a tier-one financial institution. 
I started this GitHub in 2014 and have 7 years of related working experience in the international financial market for investment and research. I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative-focused program in applied economics.
I love exploring opportunities and different vehicles, e.g. mutual funds, equity, fixed income, index, alternative products in the capital market to maximize profits. When I'm not in front of a computer screen adjusting my portfolios, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
