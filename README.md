### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, formerly an analyst at CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB Tokyo and a multi-asset Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, and a tier-one financial institution. 
I started coding since middle school and this GitHub in 2014 based on my interest and not associated with any of my employers. And I have 7 years of related working experience in the international financial market for investment and research, including 3 years working overseas. I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy (GraSPP) with a quantitative-focused program in applied economics.
I love analyzing companies' business models and exploring opportunities and different vehicles, e.g. mutual funds, equity, fixed income, ETF index, alternative products in the capital market. 

Alongside my interests in fundamental research and data analysis some of my other interests and hobbies are:
- Food, healthcare, nutrition
- Gym
- Travel
- Technologies
