### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
When I'm not in research or trading, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

I believe my current status is like an OTM option and underpay -200% comparing with what I brought to the company or to my peers.
I have more than a solid base of knowledge to generate returns from the capital market and tired of exchange what I have for nothing.
If your department or company values investment research and investment personnel enough with corresponding compensation, 
I am willing to work for you. I am open to great oppertunities and relocation.

Get in touch ðŸ‘‰  boya.chiou[at]gmail.com
