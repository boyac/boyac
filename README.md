### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
When I'm not in research or trading, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
Last year, I joined Cathay SITE's of its new department. 
With 2 people we were able to bring over $155M in AUM to the Company and carring a heavy load for product design and actively manage a fund for the government.
However, based on my current reward, I could've ask a fair but close to the market salary, and achieve nothing at Cathay SITE.
I spoke to the senior management, and the reply kept repeating as a broken answering machine; you should increase more AUM.
However, the Company kept hiring new people, more headcounts and I got underpaid or near the same pay at new grads.
I have no idea what the hack the Company is running.
