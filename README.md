I began my journey with quantitative analysis and gradually transitioned into the field of investment research. Initially, my focus was on equities, but I later expanded to include bonds, alternative investments, and risk management. During my upbringing, I observed the volatile nature of the futures-oriented investment company run by a family member. This experience made me skeptical of success stories that are portrayed superficially, as numerous investment failures could potentially devastate individuals' lives over the course of a lifetime. It is essential to thoroughly understand the characteristics and potential risks of any investment tool before utilizing it.
