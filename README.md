**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

ï¼š)

I am an experienced Financial Analyst with education and training in portfolio management and investment banking. I am proficient in using financial analysis software including Bloomberg, Stata, and Excel. I am also an R fanatic and highly skilled in SPSS, SAS, RapidMinder, Weka, and several optimization platforms. 

I received my Master's degree at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo. I have worked on several projects during my studies concerning quantitative analysis by examining the LIBOR manipulation and the CIP Arbitrage surrounding the 2008 financial crisis, and the effects of the quantitative easing programs on the emerging markets. 

I look forward to working with you on your quantitative analysis projects.
