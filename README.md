### Hi there 👋

I'm **Boya Chiou**, a quantamental portfolio manager focused on everything lucrative.
I'm currently a Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, with over $30 Billion in AUM. 
I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy with a quantitative focused program in applied economics.
**When I'm not in front of a computer screen doing research or trading**, I'm probably eating, traveling, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

For adopting this strategy, please reach out to discuss further.
(This is an original investment strategy developed a few years ago, not published anywhere and still work till today!)
“投資本身是一個孤獨的過程，是自己做決定的事，討論的人一多，變成一個委員會，你的客觀性就丟掉了，你就無法判斷成功機率了，團隊的趨同性也會發生作用，影響你的判斷。”

#### Goals in 2021
- 🚀 Learn how to drive, and go on a road trip to the east coast of Taiwan
- ⚡️ Lose 6kgs in weights and back to the gym
- 🤫 Others (Fly Delta card still have balance; Tokyo/Honolulu)
- 📖 🇺🇸 AICPA NY in 2021-2022
