### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Boya Chiou**, formerly an analyst at CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB Tokyo and a multi-asset Portfolio Manager at Cathay SITE, Taiwan's largest asset management company, and a tier-one financial institution. 
I started coding since middle school and this GitHub in 2014 based on my interest and not associated with any of my employers. And I have 7 years of working experience in the international financial market for investment and research, including 3 years working overseas. I graduated from the University of Tokyo, School of Public Policy (GraSPP) with a quantitative-focused program in applied economics.
I love analyzing companies' business models and exploring opportunities and different vehicles, e.g. mutual funds, equity, fixed income, ETF index, alternative products in the capital market. 

Boya began her career in CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB's Tokyo branch and has since worked in the Finance and Investment industry. She was an equity research analyst covering infrastructure sector and the Japanese capital market at Cathay Life investment dept., one of the world's largetest institutional and buy-side investor. Later she joined Cathay SITE as a multi-asset research analyst and portfolio manager. She received her Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and the Master's degree in a quantitative-focused program in applied economics, from the School of Public Policy, University of Tokyo.
